# BattleUnity-POC

This project is a prototype of a turn-based RPG combat system. It features :
* ATB system.
* Configurable animation per attack and fighter.
* Ability to select the action to perform.
* Very basic damage calculation.

I am doing this project to see how I can overcome errors that I have done in older ones. What I am considering error is :
* Too much call to function pointers that leads to hard to read code.
* Trying to generalize algorithm and structure too much.
